# Crop-Disease-Detection:_An-Ensemble-Approach-using-CNN-and-Transfer-Learning-Model
This project aims to classify various diseases in wheat plants using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transfer Learning models. The ensemble model is created by combining a custom CNN, InceptionV3, and Xception models. The dataset consists of images of diseased and healthy wheat plants, and extensive data preprocessing and augmentation techniques are applied. The models are trained, fine-tuned, and evaluated using appropriate metrics. The project also includes model deployment and future work suggestions.
